Java Implementation of SECD Machine + Lispkit Lisp Compiler

This is a very simple Java implementation of the original SECD from Hendersons Book.

I've taken the core of an implementation done by Miloˇs Radovanovi´c and glued in my own parser and added some test cases mainly focussing on bootstrapping of the compiler.
